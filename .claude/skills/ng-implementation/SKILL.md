## Before writing code

- Run `ng version` first; conventions differ between majors. If it fails, use `npx @angular/cli@latest`.
- Generate with `ng generate`, then `ng build` immediately and fix errors before continuing.
- Do not guess APIs: use the Angular CLI MCP server or angular.dev. If the MCP server is not configured → read `references/mcp.md`.
- If working with Signal Forms, Angular Aria, `linkedSignal`/`resource`, functional route guards or Vitest setup → read `references/version-notes.md`.

The official `angular-developer` skill (dependency `angular/skills`) covers the basics: standalone components, signals, OnPush, control flow, DI, forms. Only project conventions follow.

## Conventions

- Standalone components only, no NgModules; do not add `standalone: true` (it is the default)
- Forms: Reactive Forms by default; Signal Forms (`@angular/forms/signals`) only when requested or already used in the codebase
- Subscriptions cleaned up via `DestroyRef` / `takeUntilDestroyed`
- Upgrades: one major at a time with `ng update`; `ng generate @angular/core:control-flow` migrates legacy templates

## File naming

Match the project's existing convention. New Angular 20+ projects follow the CLI default: no `.component` / `.service` suffix (`header.ts`, class `Header`); projects that still use `*.component.ts` keep it. Never mix both in one project.

## Libraries

- `ng generate library <name> --prefix=<prefix>` inside the workspace
- `public-api.ts` is the single export surface; no deep imports
- `ng-package.json`: `lib.entryFile` points to `public-api.ts`
- Verify with `ng build <lib>` before the task is complete

## Tests

Load `ng-test` for TestBed setup, signal testing, mocking and async patterns.

## Review rules

- `OnPush`; signals for state, `computed()` for derived values
- `effect()` only for side effects, never for state updates (use `computed` or `linkedSignal`)
- `@if` / `@for` (with `track`) / `@switch`; `input()` / `output()`
- `inject()`; no constructor injection in new code
- Subscriptions cleaned up via `DestroyRef` / `takeUntilDestroyed`
- No complex template expressions; ARIA labels and `alt` text on interactive elements and images
- Library code exported only through `public-api.ts`
- New or changed behavior has tests per `ng-test`

## Scaffolding

- New standalone component (incl. the Sakai UI variant) → read `references/component.md`
- New NgRx Signal Store for feature state → read `references/signal-store.md`
